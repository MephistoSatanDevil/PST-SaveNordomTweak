This is the Save Nordom Tweak from Qwinn's Tweakpack updated for PST:EE, all credits goes to him!

Changes to Qwinn's version:
- Added HANDLE_CHARSETS (the current version included in weidu doesn't recognize PST:EE)
- Added Parchment to LeaveAreaLUA Action in SaveNordom
- Moved TakePartyItem("cube") after DropInventory() or he will DROP the cube after using it
